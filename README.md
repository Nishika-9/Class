Start

Declare variables:

h for height
l for length
w for width
vol for volume
Display "Enter the value of height:"

Read h from the user.

Display "Enter the value of length:"

Read l from the user.

Display "Enter the value of width:"

Read w from the user.

Create a Cube object, cube1, using the constructor with h, l, and w as arguments.

Call the calculateVolume method of cube1 to calculate the volume and store the result in vol.

Display "The volume of the cube is: " followed by the value of vol.

End
